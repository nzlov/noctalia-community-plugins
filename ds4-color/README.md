# DS4 Color

Set the LED lightbar colour on a connected PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 controller
from a Noctalia bar button and a color panel. Click the bar icon to apply your
saved colour, or right-click to open the panel and pick a new one.

The entire DualShock 4 output-report protocol (USB report `0x05`, Bluetooth
report `0x11` with CRC32) is implemented in **pure Lua** — no external binary or
library is required. The plugin writes the HID output report straight to
`/dev/hidrawN`.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `hy4ri/ds4-color` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `widget`; panel: `panel`; service: `service` |

## Requirements

Requires `python3` (declared in `dependencies`): if Noctalia's `writeFile` cannot
open the `/dev/hidrawN` node `O_WRONLY`, the plugin falls back to a `python3`
one-liner that performs the raw binary write. Systems without Python present cannot
apply the colour when the direct write path fails. The plugin also needs
read/write access to the DualShock 4 `/dev/hidrawN` node.

On most modern Linux desktops with `systemd-logind` and `uaccess`, the device
node is automatically accessible when you are logged in at the seat.

On headless systems or systems without `uaccess`, create a udev rule:

```udev
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="054c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="05c4|09cc|0ba0", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
```

Then add your user to the `plugdev` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
```

Re-login or run `udevadm trigger` for the change to take effect.

## Usage

**Left-click** the **DS4 Color** bar button to instantly apply the last saved
colour to every connected DualShock 4. **Right-click** the bar button (or run the
command below) to open the panel:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle hy4ri/ds4-color:panel
```

In the panel: pick a colour with the native picker, type a hex value
(`RRGGBB` / `#RRGGBB` / `0xRRGGBB`), or tap a preset. **Save** persists the
chosen colour (so left-click reapplies it later) without touching the
controller; **Apply** sets the lightbar immediately and also saves it. The saved
colour survives restarts.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `glyph` | `glyph` | `device-gamepad-2` | Icon shown on the bar button. |

## IPC

```sh
noctalia msg plugin hy4ri/ds4-color:service all apply <hex>
noctalia msg plugin hy4ri/ds4-color:service all save <hex>
```

## Notes

- Implements the DualShock 4 HID output report protocol directly in Lua
  (derived from the Linux kernel `drivers/hid/hid-playstation.c`): USB report
  id `0x05` (32 bytes) and Bluetooth report id `0x11` (78 bytes) with the
  required CRC32 checksum. No kernel drivers or external binaries.
- Detects all connected DS4 controllers (USB `0x03` and Bluetooth `0x05` bus)
  by scanning `/sys/class/hidraw/*/device/uevent` for Sony VID `054c` and
  product IDs `05c4` / `09cc` / `0ba0`.
- The last chosen colour is persisted to the plugin data directory
  (`last.json`) and restored on next open. Left-clicking the bar button applies
  the saved colour; the panel's **Save** button updates it without writing to
  the controller.
- No network access. Only the locally detected DualShock 4 controllers are
  touched.
