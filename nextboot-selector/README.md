# Next Boot Selector

Next Boot Selector selects which boot entry to boot for the next reboot only. Useful if you're dual-booting and goes back and forth to/from Windows.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `avivbintangaringga/nextboot-selector` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `nextboot-selector`; panel: `panel` |

## Requirements

This plugin mainly requires `efibootmgr` but need to escalate using `pkexec` or `sudo`. Note that if you use `sudo`, you need to set the option `NOPASSWD` for the `efibootmgr` command so it doesn't requires password to run. `reboot` command is also required if reboot on select is enabled.

## Usage

Add the `nextboot-selector` widget to a bar. Click it to show a panel that lists all boot entries on your computer. Click one of the entry to change the next boot to it.

Open the panel directly with:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle avivbintangaringga/nextboot-selector:panel
```

You can add more keywords to the exclusion list in the settings to hide unwanted entries. You also can make it automatically reboots after selecting an entry.

## Settings

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `excluded_keywords` | `string_list` | `["pxe", "uefi os", "uefi shell", "shell", "ipv4", "ipv6", "network", "diagnostics", "setup", "recovery"]` | Keywords to exclude unwanted boot entries |
| `privilege_command` | `string` | `pkexec` | Command to escalate the privilege of the `efibootmgr` command |
| `close_on_select` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to close the panel after selecting an entry |
| `reboot_on_select` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to automatically reboot after selecting an entry |
